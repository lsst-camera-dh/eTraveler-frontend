I think it would be useful if operator could decide during execution whether a sequence should be run automatically or not,
so we don't have to maintain two separate travelers or a single rather complicated traveler with a conditional branch.

Would the following work?

* Add another bit to travelerActionMask which, if set, signifies "is automatable".  The yaml ingest program would set this
bit for any container step whose child sequence consisting entirely of job harness steps.

* During execution, if this bit is set, eTraveler presents operator with option (before or after start-work?) so that
automated running may be selected.  By default it would be unselected.

* If selected eTraveler would prompt user with appropriate command to invoke the iterator script

* If not selected, execution of sequence would proceed in the usual (not-automated) manner

If we do something along these lines, there needs to be a way to indicate in the container step activity whether or not the
child steps were executed using the iterator script.

What I have currently is something which posts to

http://lsst-camera.slac.stanford.edu/eTraveler/Raw/Results/nextJob

(or similar, depending on server and db being used) with json data looking like

{"operator": "jrb", "containerid": "1234"}

Container id is Activity.id for the step with children to be automated.  Expected return data structure has two string
fields, "status" and "command". (We might want to rename "command" to something more general.)

Recognized values for status are "CMD", "DONE", or "ERROR".  If "CMD", value of "command" should be command string for next
unexecuted child step - same string as is now written to web page for manual execution. If status is "DONE",   there are no
more commands. Value of "command" will be ignored.  If "ERROR", second field can be used for an error message.   One
possible error would be the case where a child step has been started and is not yet complete.  Last I heard, we're only
supporting synchronous, so the post should only be done after previous step is complete.
